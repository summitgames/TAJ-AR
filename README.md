## Project's Title

TAJMAHAL AR - A VIRTUAL WALKTRHOUGH & STORY TELLING EXPERIENCE in AR.


## Project Description

- Discover the Taj Mahal - The Wonder of the world, a world heritage site in a new and innovative way.

- The Taj Mahal Of India is more than a monument. It's a symbol of Love and an architectural wonder to everyone, around the world. This project (app) uses Augmented Reality and immersive storytelling to bring the monument to life anywhere, wherever you are.

- The AR technology allows immersive simulation as an experience. The digital augmentation of model and replica of the monument gives a closer similar experience as is recreated “digitally” as a 3D Virtual Set using Photogrammetry Solutions and the existing surrounding 360 video experience is played around the augmented monument model.

- The product also features an educational lessons, chapter wise of the historical events, immersive storytelling and also some less known facts for all the users.


## Project Concept

- The app features multiple AR experiences in content such as a 3D Virtual Set of the monument, 360° Background that allow you to explore the iconic monument blending digital and physical world virtually. Through the app, users can access the monumnet in ways that few have been able to do before. A rich curation of stories and visual media walks you through more than 400 years of it's history — from it's origins in India in 17th Century as a symbol Of Love towards the most wish-listed travel destination in the world.

- The app also features immersive audio experiences: An exclusive podcast transports listeners to critical moments in the it's history and some unknown facts and an interactive video and audio tour guides visitors to each points of interest as they explore the gigantic momnument virtually.


## Project Features

- **Real-World-Scale Model (AR)**

Realistic Photogrammetry real-world scale, a life-size 3D model of the TAJ MAHAL using Augmented Reality. Place the model in front of you, pinch and zoom in to scale, and rotate, move around your environment in open space.

- **360° Immersive**

The 360 Video backgrounds woulld rec-create the magical architecture as is, where you are. The expertience blends physical with 360 background to give complete experience.

- **Virtual Audio Guide**
An Audio tour experience will be a virtual guide and to tell stories. On-Location Audio Tour with historical events and Podcasts Mini-series.

- **Time-lapse (180° Experience)**

A time lapse view of the environment from morning, evening and night. The virtual background will give similar with with the monumnet on users screen.

- **Historical and Educational Content**

The content and design includes first-person narratives and stories with historians, who tell the fascinating and historical events and from musuem archives.


## Project Use-case

- The project show-cases the potential of AR and Photogrammetry Technology in the **Tourism**, **History**, **Advertising** and **Architectural** Industry. The digital simulation content and experience is designed for Historical, Travel and Content Creators field to study, learn and experience which is specially designed for people who couldn't travel and visit this architectural Wonder of the World.

- **Tourism**

It showcases the potential to promote using innovative ways in the tourism industry/sector, digital simulation, curated story and overall experience will advance the interests of people visting the place. 

- **History**
It further establishes how historical events could be told in a creatively as a story and as a full experience. The learning could be more intuitive for students and create a unique curosity for historical ethusiasts.

- **Marketing/Advertising**

The marketing and advertising units of any organisation must adopt this use-case for their respective exposure of any place such as Musuems, Theme Parks, Architectural Buildings/Projects, Tourism hotspots, etc.

- **Architectural**

The real-estate industry, heritage landmarks, architectural buildings, plots and centre of most iconic hotspots could be realisitically demonstrated and given an overview for approvals, client feedback, design planning, construction process, and thus saving time and money and efforts and a pre-visualation before the production or tender is allocated.


## Project Purpose

- The Project is developed for travellers, history-buffs and creators worldwide and for those who could not visit the monument, they can do this using AR Technology as a virtual experience. 

- The project (app) will also give people to augment and take pictures being in it as it blends digital and physical world together. users could pose with the iconic monument and create stories, memories and share it on social platforms.

- Travellers and Tourists Worldwide can mark a tick on thier travel wish list as visited. Differently abled childrens and young adults can experience everything as is.

- The project would also be a virtual guide, educate travellers of it's history, important events and an end-to-end one platform who can learn from such a case-study subject.


## Project Scope

- The Software will be an entire digital re-creation of the existing TAJ MAHAL monument as a virtual set. These virtual sets will be designed in 3D world with real space replica and other environmental factors to give the same look and feel of just being there. Users are recommended to augment the model in an open space for a better experience.

- The User will have accessibility of scanning the surface environment through their AR Camera and a 360 Field of View with digital and physical real world in a 6 DOF Movement using their phone gyro system.

- The 360 background immersive audio+videos content will be played around surrounding these digital sets in the app. The users will be able to see, rotate, listen and interact with the content in the software throughout the experience.

- All the historical events, important dates, musuem pictures/archives would be shocased as an interactable Designed Menu for all Immersive Content as a list.

- Virtual Gallery in the app (Users can read about the history of the monument.)

- 360 3D Binaural Audio story podcasts and background voice overs for complete immersive experience.
